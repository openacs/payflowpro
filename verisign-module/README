*** This version of verisign.so enhanced and modified by Janine Sisk
of furfly.net, LLC (janine@furfly.net)

This directory contains version 1.0 of an interface to VeriSign for
AOLServer, and is provided as a replacement for the Cybercash module
written by Jin Choi.  Please send Brad Duell (bduell@ncacasi.org) 
any feedback/modifications you may have.

This VeriSign interface is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at
your option) any later version.

This software was developed under Linux 2.2 using gcc 2.95.2,
AOLserver 33.13, and the VeriSign SDK 3.00. Other environments or
versions may or may not require changes.

INSTALLATION
* Unpack the SDK from VeriSign.
* Edit the variables at the top of Makefile and verisign.c.
* Run 'make install'.
* Edit your AOLserver nsd.ini to include
  ns_param   verisign	      PATH_TO_VERISIGN_MODULE/verisign.so
  under the modules section.
* Restart AOLserver.

This module defines three Tcl procedures for the AOLserver API:
   cc_generate_order_id, returns a unique order ID (not useful if you
      are generating keys with an Oracle sequence or whatever)
	cc_send_to_server_21, access to the direct VeriSign API documented 
		in the PayFlow Pro (Version 3.00) Developer's Guide.
	cc_do_direct_payment, access to the directpaycredit facility documented 
		in the PayFlow Pro (Version 3.00) Developer's Guide.

Usage:

cc_generate_order_id -> string

cc_send_to_server_21 <command> <input ns_set> <output ns_set> (optional server)
        Takes two ns_sets, for input and output values. Does not clear
        out the output ns_set before filling it with results.

cc_do_direct_payment <command> <input ns_set> <output ns_set> (optional server)
        Takes two ns_sets, for input and output values. Does not clear
        out the output ns_set before filling it with results.
